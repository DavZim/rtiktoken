Note for resubmit, fixed NOTEs around spelling, parallel execution, extra files, and no rustc version reported.

One NOTE will remain, which is a 403 from https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer. This is, I think, a false positive as the user-agent of the URL checker is blocked by OpenAI, in other words, the URL is correct but seems to block when checked automatically.
